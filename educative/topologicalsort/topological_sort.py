"""
Topological sort of a directed graph (a graph with unidirected edges) is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for
every directed edge(U, V) from vertex U to vertex V, U comes before V in the ordering.
Given a directed graph, find the topological ordering of its vertices.
Example 1:
I/P: Vertices=4, Edges=[3, 2], [3, 0], [2, 0], [2, 1]
O/P: Following are the two valid topological sorts for the given graph:
1) 3, 2, 0, 1
2) 3, 2, 1, 0

Example 2:
I/P: Vertices=5, Edges=[4, 2], [4, 3], [2, 0], [2, 1], [3, 1]
O/P: Following are the two valid topological sorts for the given graph:
1) 4, 2, 3, 0, 1
2) 4, 3, 2, 0, 1
3) 4, 3, 2, 1, 0
4) 4, 2, 3, 1, 0
5) 4, 2, 0, 3, 1

Example 2:
I/P: Vertices=7, Edges=[6, 4], [6, 2], [5, 3], [5, 4], [3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2], [4, 1]
O/P: Following are the all valid topological sorts for the given graph:
1) 5, 6, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2
2) 6, 5, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2
3) 5, 6, 4, 3, 0, 2, 1
4) 6, 5, 4, 3, 0, 1, 2
5) 5, 6, 3, 4, 0, 2, 1
6) 5, 6, 3, 4, 1, 2, 0
There are other valid topological ordering of the graph too.

Time: In step 'd', each vertex will become a source only once and each edge will be accessed and removed once. Therefore
    the time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(V+E), where 'V' is the total number of vertices and 'E' is the
    total number of edges in the graph.
Space: The space complexity will be O(V+E), since we are storing all of the edges for each vertex in an adjacency list.
